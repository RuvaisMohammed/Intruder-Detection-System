It is a Python program created using OpenCV and the face_recognition library. It works based on the principle of supervised learning, comparing the captured image with trained images of authorized persons to make predictions.

The image is captured using camera and compares the image with the image of authorized user stored in the secondary memory unit.

If the captured image didnâ€™t match the stored image the will be noted as intruder.

Capturing of images is based on the concept of computer vision, pixel adjustment is based on the concept of image processing and comparison of the captured image is based on the concept of supervised learning.

If the captured image matches the image of the authorized person it displays the name of the folder which is named after the authorized person.
